# VoiceAssistantDonny
This is a basic voice assistant program with very few functions. It is written in python using pyttsx3. I continue adding functions to it.
This version can only hear and understand few known commands listed below-
1- Say '<subject/topic> wikipedia' to open wikipedia on that subject.
2- Say 'Open youtube' to open youtube in the os browser.
3- Say 'open google' to open web browser with google.com
4- Say 'Latest News' to hear out the top 5 news headlines from region ='India' (this part has to be improved)
5- Say 'Play music' to play the music in the defined directory.
6- Say 'Who are you' will reply some intro
7- Say 'Goodbye' or any error fetching any voice command will exit the program.
further adding more interesting functions to it.
